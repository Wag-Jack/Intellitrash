# Installation on Raspberry Pi
In order to utilize the Grove Time-of-Flight Distance Sensor VL53L0X, you need to clone the following repository onto your Raspberry Pi to ensure it functions properly.

https://github.com/johnbryanmoore/VL53L0X_rasp_python.git

Once this has been installed, placed the "Intellitrash_RPi.py" file into the following directory:

{directory storing VL53LOX sensor dependencies}/VL53L0X_rasp_python/python

Once that is done, run the "Intellitrash_RPi.py" file on your Pi to set up the server, and you should be all set to run the Intellitrash system!
